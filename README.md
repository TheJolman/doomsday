simple C++ implementation of the doomsday algorithm.

Building:
```sh
make
```

Usage:
```
Usage: ./build/doomsday [-h|--help] mm/dd/yyyy

This program calculates the day of the week that (nearly) any date falls on. It uses the Doomsday rule derived by John Conway. For more information, see the Wikipedia article on the topic

This was one of my first coding projects, came back a few years later to clean
it up.
